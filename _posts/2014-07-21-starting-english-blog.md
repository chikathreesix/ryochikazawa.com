title: Starting English blog
---

I\'m Ryo Chikazawa, software engineer from Tokyo, Japan and currently based in Singapore. I write mainly JavaScript and also Ruby, sometimes Objective-C. My favorite editor is MacVim.

Originaly I have [my Japanese blog](http://chikathreesix.com), but since I moved to Singapore I thought I should have English one too.
