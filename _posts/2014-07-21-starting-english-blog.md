I\'m Ryo Chikazawa, software engineer from Tokyo, Japan and currently based in Singapore. I write mainly JavaScript and also Ruby, sometimes Objective-C. My favorite editor is MacVim. I\'m also a guitarist and a heavy metal lover.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/chikathreesix), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chikathreesix), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ryo.chikazawa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ryo-chikazawa/49/337/15). You can also [email](mailto:chikathreesix@gmail.com) me for more inquiries. Basically I use `chikathreesix` as a nickname through a lot of services.

Originaly I have [my Japanese blog](http://chikathreesix.com), but since I moved to Singapore, I thought I should have English one too. The Japanese blog is built by Wordpress and hosted on a hosting server, however, I felt it\'s a little bit obsolete. I didn\'t want to look for a new server and install something on it again. And also I wanted to write posts in markdown. So what I did is, I built this blog with Jekyll and it is hosted on Github Pages. I\'d like to write about this in another post anyway.

I will write about mainly HTML5, JavaScript and Ruby in this blog. If you have any comments, feel free to send me a metion on Twitter.
