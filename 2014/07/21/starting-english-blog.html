<p>I'm Ryo Chikazawa, software engineer from Tokyo, Japan and currently based in Singapore. I write mainly JavaScript and also Ruby, sometimes Objective-C. My favorite editor is MacVim.</p>

<p>Originaly I have <a href="http://chikathreesix.com">my Japanese blog</a>, but since I moved to Singapore I thought I should have English one too.</p>
