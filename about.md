# About

I\'m Ryo Chikazawa, software engineer from Tokyo, Japan and currently based in Singapore. I write mainly JavaScript and also Ruby, sometimes Objective-C. My favorite editor is MacVim. I\'m also a guitarist and a heavy metal lover.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/chikathreesix), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chikathreesix), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ryo.chikazawa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ryo-chikazawa/49/337/15). You can also [email](mailto:chikathreesix@gmail.com) me for more inquiries. Basically I use `chikathreesix` as a nickname through a lot of services.
